In this project the prompt was based on a dueling system in which there are 
three participants, Aaron, Bob, and Charlie. Aaron hits 1/3 of his shots, 
Bob hits 1/2 of his shots, and Charlie never misses. 
To compensate for this they shoot in ABC order to that the shooters 
are arranged from worst to best. The participants also aim for the best 
shooter still alive. The goal was to run the duel 10,000 times and to show 
the number of victories for each participant.  We were prompted to provide a 
user interface as well as unit tests for all of our methods. The main things 
I learned from this project were the fundamentals and implementation of unit 
testing, the utilization of random numbers in c++, as well as how to use 
references and pointers in the arguments of methods.
