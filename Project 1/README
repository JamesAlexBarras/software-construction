In this project the prompt was to take in the following: 
loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment,Â 
and to then output the number of months taken to pay off the loan as well as 
the total interest paid. Also, a chart was outputted to 
show the balance, payment, rate, interest, and principal for each month. 
The main thing I learned from this project was the 
utilization of .setf() and .precision() methods when specifying the format 
for numerical outputs.
